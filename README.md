# Track and analyse in/outdoor climbing progression

A couple of month ago I started recording information about all of my climbing activities both in- and outdoors. Initially, my main motivation was to keep track of the many routes my [local climbing gym](https://www.kletterzentrum-innsbruck.at/en/) offers, in order to know what I had already red pointed, attempted, or still needed to try. Soon, I realised that this data could also be analysed to give insights into my climbing progression, as well as comparing my climbing stats to that of others.

Even though the analyses will probably work for every climbing gym, it requires a way of discriminating the different routes in some way.
Currently, the analysis will therefore only work for my [specific gym](https://www.kletterzentrum-innsbruck.at/en/) which uses numbers, colors, and grades.

Hopefully, as the dataset gets bigger I will be able to improve on what to take notes on.
